Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock

This is My First Python program that allows you to play the game "rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock" against the computer. The game is a variation of the classic game of rock-paper-scissors, introduced in the TV series "The Big Bang Theory". The game includes two additional options, lizard and Spock, and has slightly different rules.
